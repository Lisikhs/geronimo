# Geronimo messaging platform

## Next steps
1. setup database with help of JPA + Hibernate (use sessionFactory, create entities)
2. cache Luxmed credentials into database and read them for security 
(create initial database with hashed password and ship it with the project, and we'll also need to be able to unhash it to)
3. Whatever.  
4. implement search of available doctor sessions.
